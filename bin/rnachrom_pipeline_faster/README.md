# BaRDIC
Binomial RNA-DNA interaction caller.

## Installation

You will need python >= 3.8. We advise using a separate conda environment.

1. Download this repo.
2. Navigate inside it with `cd BaRDIC`.
3. Run `pip install .`.

## Running

This is a command line tool. Please refer to the [instruction](./docs/running.md). CLI is under development so there might be breaking changes with new releases.

Public python API is still in development, API reference will be available later. There might be breaking changes with new releases.

Output file formats are more or less stable.

## Soon

1. Python API reference.
2. Better docs.
3. Groundbreaking changes in API and CLI (sorry).
